                It all started in 2013 when seven international collegues who came from Ghana, Ukraine, America, France,
                Ethiopia, Rwanda and Belgium to work here in Germany found it difficult to adjust to the German culture,
                language
                and conventions.
                After some few months of troubles, they decides to learn the language and the culture in depth. Within a
                year, they were already acquinted with the new environment.
                They realized that their new colleagues who also came from other countries face the same issues of
                adaptation to the extent that one of their America friends got into jail for a law he did not know
                existed.
                They helped him out with good lawyers. But it was so costly.
                Since this incident, the seven friends decided to help all their foreign friends to know about the
                German laws in order for them not to get into trouble.
                With this idea, they formed a whatsapp group and tried to add new collegues form their workplace.
                Subsequently, the group expanded as people from outside
                the workplace were introduced. The group begun to get bigger and bigger.
                Then they had an idea to organize city tour. This is the point where the idea of sporting activities was
                introduced. They started with cycling and then Subsequently
                added motorsports, surfing, hiking, long and table-tennis. Later, other sports like skating were
                introduced and they keep adding on based on the interest of their members.
                Now the group has about 960 members from all over Berlin. Each member helps voluntarily with what they
                have namely; expertise, funds, tools and equipments inter alia.
                Thus, we support one another with our abilities as each member contributes to the growth of the group.
                We prioritize making our members feel at home.
